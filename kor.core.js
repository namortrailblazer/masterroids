	index & id pool

	These kinds of pools have each different requirements.

	An index pool returns indices used for arrays. It ensures that index values are as low as possible.
	This is done by immediately returning a released index once a new one is queried.

	An id pool ensures to reuse released ids as late as possible.
	That can be necessary e.g. for ids of entities used over network communication.
	Communication delays can cause short inconsistencies of existing and released
	ids on different machines when trying to keep them concurrent.
	To prevent conflicts, a machine should not release an id and again
	get the same one again on the next immediately following query because another machine
	might not have enough time to get informed that the id now belongs to another entity.

	The provided pool mainly is an index pool.
	But its internal implementation will return the oldest released index when querying anotherone.
	That is, returned indices are held in a queue rather than a stack.
	This enables being used as id pool when ensuring to initially reserve many dummy indices
	(just as fakes, non existing entities).
	The sense is just to keep the gap long between releasing and reviving of an index value.
	To make it long enough, you have to make sure to pass an appropriate value for initially_released.
	A good value might be an equivalent for several seconds. E.g. if you have at most frequent phases
	let's say 100 indices to retrieve and release within one second, a good value could be to set
	it to 500 (the equivalent for 5 seconds in this sample) so that the time gap between releasing
	and reviving an index value does not go under 5 seconds approximately.

==========================================
*/

	//! Returns and reserves indices.
	/*!
		When releasing an index, it can be reused later on.

		This makes sense when your number of indices is growing and shrinking repeatedly over time
		but you want to use them as indices into an array. Reusing those indices will prevent
		too many items being created in the array which later on would never be used again
		if the dismissed indices could not be reused.
