			This is a helper function used when creating a flying_object whose starting position

			<code>
				this.make_relative_to( parent_flying_object );
				this.calc_absolute_for_rel();
				this.detach();
			</code>
			The only difference is that make_relative_to() would add this object to the parent's
			children array which would cause this array (which in fact is a ordered_dictionary)
			to become resorted. The problem is that this sort does not guarantee the order of
			elements recognized as equal in sort order (so with same priority). The result would
			be when doing the 3 calls above that objects of same priority are reordered and
			you can see that e.g. with guards or protectors of a player ship:
			Imagine you have 2 guards and when you start a shot and the shot is made
			relative and detached immediately on its creation, the order of the guards could
			have changed because they have same priority. The visible result is that the guards suddenly
			exchange their positions because they exchanged the nearest targets to aim on.
			To prevent that, this method can be used which will not touch the parent's children
